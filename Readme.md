My slightly eccentric, but personally essential, Geany colour schemes for a black editor background 


### Notes

Colours are inverted codes, to conform with the 'inverted' editor background.

Geany v. 1.23 Linux


### Location

*/usr/share/geany/filetypes.x*


### Usage

Backup the default files in the above location.

Copy and replace the new colour codes.
